            <p> Right of Withdrawal and Refund for European Union customers</p>

            <p> This Condition 12 only applies to European Union (&ldquo; EU&rdquo;) customers.</p>

            <p> EU law provides you with a right of withdrawal on software sales (i.e. the agreement between you and
                Us). This can be excluded for digitally provided content once the content is provided to the end user.
                The EU statutory right of withdrawal ends 14 days after you purchase or (where you have provided the
                appropriate consent and acknowledgement) the moment you start downloading the content and services for
                the first time (whichever is sooner).</p>

            <p> We are obligated to inform you of your EU right of withdrawal in detail, which you can find in Schedule
                1. If this Condition 12 should in any way differ from Schedule 1, the terms in Schedule 1 shall
                prevail.</p>

            <h3> Further Rights</h3>

            <p> Because you are a consumer, We are under a legal duty to supply Products that are in conformity with the
                Contract. As a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to Products that are faulty, not as described
                or not provided with reasonable skill and care. These legal rights are not affected by your right of
                withdrawal referred to in Condition 12 and Schedule 1 or anything else in these Terms. Advice about your
                legal rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.</p>

            <h3> Delivery</h3>

            <p> Delivery of Products from the Webstore is performed by Us. The terms relating to this may form part of
                your Contract. You should contact Us in the event that you have any queries or issues in respect of
                this.</p>

            <h3> Price of Products</h3>

            <p> The price of Products to be paid by you is set by Us and will be as quoted on the Webstore at the time
                you submit your order.</p>

            <p> We may change the prices from time to time, but changes will not affect any order you have already
                placed that has been accepted by Us.</p>

            <p> Payment processing related to Products purchased on the Webstore is performed by us and our third-party
                payment processors.</p>

            <p> If VAT (or any similar sales tax) is chargeable on any payments for Products in any territory, we will
                add such VAT amount to the price to be paid by you.</p>

            <p> The terms relating to any mistake caused by incorrect pricing or incorrect treatment of VAT are as
                agreed between you and Us.</p>

            <h3> How to pay</h3>

            <p> You can only pay for Products using payment methods we specify during your checkout flow.</p>

            <p> When you provide payment information to us you represent to us that you are the authorised user of the
                card, PIN, key or account associated with that payment and you authorise us to process your payment with
                our chosen third-party payment processors for any fees incurred by you. We may require you to provide
                your address or other information in order to meet our obligations under applicable tax law.</p>

            <p> You agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise your place of residence,
                whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on game content, to purchase at pricing not appropriate
                to your geography, or for any other purpose.</p>

            <p> Please note that some payment methods may attract additional fees for reasons including but not limited
                to: currency conversions, gateway fees, originator fees. We recommend you check closely the amount to
                pay on the confirmation screen provided by any acquirer or PSP used by us.</p>

            <h3> Our liability</h3>

            <p> If we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a
                foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or our negligence, but we are not responsible for any
                loss or damage that is not foreseeable.</p>

            <p> Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by
                you and us at the time we entered into these Terms.</p>

            <p> Loss or damage is not foreseeable if it relates to a loss of goodwill, computer failure or malfunction,
                any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages, any delay or inability
                to use the Products or any other damages arising out of or in any way connected with the Products.</p>

            <p> We do not in any way exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury caused by our
                negligence or fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

            <h3> Third-Party Sites</h3>

            <p> The Webstore may provide links to other third-party sites or third party vendors who provide content,
                goods and or services on the Internet. Any separate charge or obligations you incur in your dealings
                with these third parties is your responsibility. We make no representation or warranties, either express
                or implied, regarding any third-party site.</p>

            <h3> Other important terms</h3>

            <p> We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation, but this will not
                affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.</p>

            <p> You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in
                writing.</p>

            <p> These Terms are between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of their terms,
                whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise. However, we and you will
                not need the consent of a recipient of your gift of a Product to cancel or make any changes to these
                Terms.</p>

            <p> Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any provision or part-provision of these
                Terms is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed deleted, but that shall not
                affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of this agreement. If any court or relevant authority
                decides that any of the conditions are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain
                in full force and effect.</p>

            <p> If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce
                our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights
                against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a
                default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive
                any later default by you.</p>

            <p> Please note that these Terms are governed by English law. This means any dispute or claim arising out of
                or in connection with them will be governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of
                England and Wales will have non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, if you are a resident of Northern
                Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are a resident of Scotland, you
                may also bring proceedings in Scotland.</p>

            <p> As a consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are
                resident. Nothing in these terms and conditions, including Condition 19.6 affects your rights as a
                consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.</p>

            <h3> Schedule 1 &ndash; Right of Withdrawal for EU Customers</h3>

            <p> This Schedule only applies to EU customers.</p>

            <p> As a user of the Webstore domiciled in an EU member state, you have the right to withdraw from any
                purchase on the Webstore without giving any reason.</p>

            <p> For any digital content purchased online, you have agreed upon checkout that the withdrawal period will
                expire 14 days after you purchase such digital content or when you start downloading the content for the
                first time, whichever is sooner.</p>

            <p> To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform Us of your decision in writing by email to withdraw
                from the purchase by an unequivocal statement.</p>

            <p> To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your
                exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>
